# Home Credit Default Risk

To run the script you will need to alter the path to the dataset.
Please change the path accordingly.
The dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk.

In the csv it is possible to see the results from the script.

Unfortunately the loading bars used while training failed to save and thus are showing up weirdly inside the jupyter.
