# Cover Forest type prediction

To run this script please change the path to the dataset.
The dataset can be downloaded from the following link:
    https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction
    
The results can be found in the CSV file.

Unfortunately the loading bars used while training failed to save and thus are showing up weirdly inside the jupyter.
The original script for the logistic regression can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/topic-10-practice-with-logit-rf-and-lightgbm
Note: not the whole notebook was used only the logistic regression part.
